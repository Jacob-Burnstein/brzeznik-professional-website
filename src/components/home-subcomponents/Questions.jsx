      <h2 className="question">Who are Music Therapists?</h2>
      <p className="answer">
        Music therapists are more than just music teachers or entertainers:
        music therapists are trained professionals who specialize in selecting
        and using music interventions - or activities that involve music - to
        target a client's unique goals. To be a music therapist, one must hold a
        Bachelor's degree or higher from a college or university program that's
        been approved by the American Music Therapy Association. In addition to
        educational coursework, they must compete at least 1200 supervised hours
        of clinical training, including a supervised internship. Lastly, they
        must pass the national board certification exam to obtain the credential
        MT-BC (Music Therapist-Board Certified), which is necessary for
        professional practice.
